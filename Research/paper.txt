Dynamic Traffic Modeling From Overhead Imagery{

	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Workman_Dynamic_Traffic_Modeling_From_Overhead_Imagery_CVPR_2020_paper.html
	
	There goal is to use overhead imagery to understand patterns in traffic flow, for instance answering questions such as how fast could you traverse Times.
	They propose an automatic approach for generating dynamic maps of traffic speeds using convolutional neural networks

Connect-and-Slice: An Hybrid Approach for Reconstructing 3D Objects{
	https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/html/Fang_Connect-and-Slice_An_Hybrid_Approach_for_Reconstructing_3D_Objects_CVPR_2020_paper.html

	In this paper, they address this issue with an hybrid method that successively connects and slices planes detected from 3D data. 
	The core idea is constructing an efficient and compact partitioning data structure. 
	
	Later they say 
		`spatially-adaptive in the sense`
		`composed of components with different structural`
